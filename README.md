# SnakeGamePython
An implementation of the snake game using python 3

## Aim
The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake.The snake continually gets longer as it moves. So there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, other obstacle, or itself.
